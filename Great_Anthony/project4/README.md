# Baltimore Homicide Statistics Analysis

## Project Description
This project analyzes Baltimore homicide statistics to provide insights for policy makers and law enforcement. The program answers two critical questions about homicide patterns in Baltimore.

## Questions Answered

### Question 1: Surveillance Camera Effectiveness
Analyzes the percentage of homicides involving firearms versus other weapons and tracks how this ratio has changed over the decades. This information is crucial for understanding the role of gun violence and informing policy decisions around firearm regulations.

### Question 2: Youth Violence Patterns
Examines when homicides are most likely to occur (by month and day of week) and how patterns differ across age groups. This analysis helps law enforcement optimize resource allocation and develop targeted intervention strategies for high-risk times and demographics.
